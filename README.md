# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

Our goal is to make a fun interactive citizen science app for people to explore both native and exotic wildlife, a little like iNaturalist. People can quickly pull up photos, videos, or recordings of plants and animals. They will be able to access ready information pulled from online encyclopedias like Wikipedia. This app will also let users connect with others so they can form a friendly group to go on outings together.

## User stories

### As a user:
- I want to take and upload photos, videos, or recordings of native plants and animals I find
- I want to edit or delete posts
- I want to manage how the app collects my personal data (age, gender, location, social relationships) to better protect my privacy
- I want to access and comment on other people's content
- I want to connect with and befriend other naturists so we can form groups to go on outings, do research, and build a personal relationship
- I want to discuss footage with other users either through forums, groupchats, channels, or private/public messages
- I want to connect with professional ecologists, biologists, or wildlife photographers to learn more about their work and how I could support it
- I want to contribute to scientific research via informal citizen science
- I want to access ready, available information from encyclopedias or guidebooks about the specimens I find, like anatomy, evolution, behavior, and conservation status
- I want to learn about which species I encounter are threatened, and personal steps I can take to protect or help them
- I want to get the latest news or research on plants and animals
- I want to identify animals and plants from photo scans, analysis of recordings (e.g, bird songs)
- I want to predict age, sex, and other demographic data of animals from photo/recording scans
- I want information to be geotagged so I can see other people's observations on a map, like around my neighborhood, in another region, or in another country
- I want to access other users' photos/videos/recordings of exotic wildlife
  
### As a researcher/academic:
- I want to publicly share my research projects and crowdsource footage and data
- I want to recruit members of the public to crowdsource observations for me
- I want to publish scholarly articles or my research about plants and animals
- I want to connect with other academic researchers so we can develop a personal/work relationship and conduct research projects together
- I want to answer questions from the public about my work and how they can help
- I want to share information about threats to biodiversity and how users can better protect it
- I want to answer people's questions about identifying plants and animals, their biology, their lives, their evolution, etc.

## Steps necessary to run the software

1. Clone the git repository:
'git clone'
2. Set up pip and environment variables
3. Run the app
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   flask run
   ```
5. Stop the app by
